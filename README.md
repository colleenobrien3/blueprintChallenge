# BluePrint Interactive Coding Challenge

## Description

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my challenge! I believe I hit most of the requirements and bonuses! The deployed site is linked below. I did include a basic form validation and a few media queries to increase responsiveness. Please ignore the testingCodePen.js file - just an extra testing environment I used since CodePen can get cramped.

## Languages and Technologies
